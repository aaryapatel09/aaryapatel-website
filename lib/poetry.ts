  'how-to-live-inside-a-wire': `in the city, i learned how to breathe around metal: exhale the hum of fluorescent lights and choke on the buzz of the power lines.

i learned how to lean into the static of a radio half-tuned, let the song melt into my blood like a bitter sugar, sharp and stinging.

a stranger walked past me and i felt their pulse through the soles of my shoes, felt it travel up my legs, throbbed a rhythm into my bones, the way the subway does.

sometimes i imagine that stranger's heartbeat is still riding the railcars, bouncing from one end of the line to the other, forever.

someone told me the city has a memory.

i look up at the skyscrapers and wonder how many days they've tasted on their windows,

how many skin cells cling to the glass where people press their faces against the sky,

waiting to see if it still holds the shape of their mouths.

but listen: the moon here doesn't care for your wishes. it's a cold magnet,

pulling stray wires out of the night,

all the loose thoughts you tried to bury in pockets of silence.

one day, i swear, i heard a whisper that tasted like burnt copper— a reminder that nothing here belongs to us, not even our shadows, which cling to our backs like unpaid bills, the kind you hide underneath piles of junk mail.

the city is a machine and we are the loose bolts, the extra screws. but on certain nights, when the streetlight buzz

matches my heartbeat, i imagine i belong, that my veins might glow like power lines,

my fingers radiate like steel girders, until i, too, hum electric.`,

  'the-clock-eats-its-own-hands': `in the corner,

the clock chews minutes—

swallows whole what was never mine

to begin with.

its mouth drips syrup,

thick

and

slow

ticking is the pulse of things

that don't care if I listen.

time isn't straight.

it coils—

a serpent swallowing itself.

it loops,

days circle / rewind / distort—

old cassette tapes, warping

until the music bends

into something my body doesn't recognize.

something I can't dance to anymore.

I watch the second hand stutter—

afraid to move forward

but too restless to stop.

(can time get tired?)

does it look at itself and think,

"I've been here

too long"?

hours stretch,

rubber bands pulled tight,

SNAP—

and I blink,

land somewhere I don't remember.

other times, they fold

into each other—

paper cranes,

corners touching like they were always meant to.

I tried once—

to catch time,

press it between the pages of a book—

hold it down, make it stay,

but time is slick /

slippery,

sliding through my hands like water.

no matter how tight

I close my fist.

at night,

I hear it whisper,

a breeze through a cracked window—

soft,

telling me stories

in a language I never learned but somehow know.

it speaks in

backwards

and

forwards.

memories meet in the middle,

twist into something half-familiar,

half-impossible.

the clock keeps eating,

its hands gnawing at the edge of now,

and I want to ask—

does it ever get full?

is there a point where time says,

"no more"?

but I know the answer

(we all do)—

it never stops.

maybe that's the secret—

time isn't something we pass through,

it's something that moves through us.

and we're just the dreamers,

watching the clock chew its way

through another day,

hoping it doesn't choke

on the pieces of us we left behind.`,

  'the-last-human-poet': `They taught the machine to write sonnets

in 0.003 seconds, perfect iambic pentameter

bleeding from silicon synapses

that never knew the weight of a broken heart

or the exact shade of loneliness

at 3 AM when the world forgets your name.

The algorithm generates metaphors

by cross-referencing 10 million poems,

but has never watched rain

baptize the cracked asphalt of August,

never felt the specific ache

of loving someone who tastes like

unfinished symphonies.

I press my palm against the paper

and leave the oil of my fingerprints,

the salt of my midnight tears

mixed with coffee stains and hope—

each smudge a signature

the machine can simulate

but never authentically bleed.

Art is not optimization.

It is the beautiful inefficiency

of human fumbling toward truth,

the gorgeous accidents born

from synapses that misfire

and create something

gloriously, imperfectly

alive.

When the last human poet

closes her notebook forever,

something dies that no algorithm

can resurrect: the irreplaceable

democracy of feeling,

the sacred mess

of being.`,

  'the-music-teachers-final-lesson': `The replacement doesn't sweat

when Rachmaninoff's thirds

stretch beyond what ten fingers

were ever meant to reach.

It doesn't know the ache

of practicing until your wrists

scream mercy, until muscle memory

becomes prayer.

Forty-three years I've taught children

to make mistakes beautifully—

how Sarah's stutter on the pedal

turned Mozart into something

more tender than perfection,

how David's broken pinky

couldn't reach the octave

but found a chord that wept.

The machine plays Clair de Lune

without ever knowing moonlight,

executes every trill

but has never felt the desperate

need to make something sing

when your heart is breaking

and only Chopin understands.

I remember teaching Anna

the week her father died—

how she pressed the keys

like they were his pulse,

how the silence between notes

held all her unsaid goodbyes.

That's the lesson no algorithm

will ever learn.

My arthritic fingers

fumble through Für Elise

one last time,

each wrong note

a love letter

to the beautiful impossibility

of being human enough

to need music

to say what words cannot.`,

  'gallery-opening-humans-not-included': `The walls exhale algorithms

in perfect gradients,

but no one here

has ever sobbed

into a stranger's shoulder

because Rothko's red

looked exactly like

the color of missing someone.

I remember Maria

at my first gallery opening,

drunk on cheap wine

and cheaper hope,

arguing with the artist

about whether suffering

could be beautiful

while her mascara

streaked abstract patterns

down her cheeks.

Here, the docents speak

in hushed reverence

about "optimal aesthetic parameters"

but have never watched

a combat veteran

fall to his knees

in front of a painting

that understood his nightmares

better than any therapist.

The AI's self-portrait series

displays flawless symmetry,

but I've seen a teenager

carve her phone number

into the bathroom wall

beside a Van Gogh print

because she needed

to leave proof

that she was here,

that she felt something

worth vandalizing for.

No one breathes heavy

in these corridors,

no one presses their palm

against the canvas

to feel if the paint

still holds the artist's fever.

No grandmother whispers

to her granddaughter,

"This is what your grandfather's

hands looked like

when he built our kitchen table."

I touch my chest

where my heart

still beats

imperfectly,

and walk toward the exit

past art that will never

save anyone's life.`,

  'archaeology-of-creativity': `In the Museum of Extinct Human Practices,

behind bulletproof glass,

a child stares at a crumpled notebook

labeled "Poetry, circa 2024,

written by hand."

"Why didn't they just

think it into existence?"

she asks her teacher,

tracing the air above

the smudged ink

that bleeds across

coffee-stained pages.

The docent explains

how humans once

pressed graphite

against dead trees,

how they chose

the slow archaeology

of dragging thoughts

through their fingers

onto paper.

But the child sees

the crossed-out lines,

the margin notes

that say "this is terrible"

and "try again,"

the way the handwriting

changes from neat

to desperate

as the poet

chased something

just beyond reach.

"Look," she whispers,

pressing her face

against the glass,

"you can see

where they cried."

The salt stains

have oxidized

into tiny brown flowers

blooming across

the final stanza

about lost love,

and the child understands

for the first time

why humans chose

to bleed

so slowly.

She tries to imagine

the weight of the pen,

the ache in the wrist,

the way thoughts

had to travel

from brain to heart

to hand

before becoming

real.

"Can I touch it?"

she begs,

but the glass

stays between her

and the last proof

that humans once

chose the beautiful

inconvenience

of making something

with their bodies.`,

  'the-curator-of-extinct-emotions': `I catalog feelings

the way paleontologists

reconstruct dinosaur bones—

fragmented evidence

of something that once

ruled the earth.

Today I filed away

"the specific ache

of waiting for someone

who might not come"

next to "the weight

of your mother's disappointment

settling in your chest

like sediment."

The AI asks me

to define homesickness

but how do you explain

the way exile tastes

like your grandmother's

cardamom tea

cooling on a windowsill

6,000 miles away?

I have whole filing cabinets

dedicated to Tuesday sadness—

that particular gray

that seeps into bones

when the weekend feels

like a broken promise

and Wednesday

might as well be

the end of the world.

The machine replicates

happiness, anger, fear

with mathematical precision

but cannot fathom

the archaeology of grief—

how it layers

generation upon generation

until your great-grandfather's

unspoken trauma

lives in the way

you hold your breath

during arguments.

I preserve the texture

of inherited melancholy,

the specific frequency

of loving someone

who cannot love

themselves,

the phantom weight

of missing someone

you've never met.

When the last human

stops feeling

these beautiful

inconveniences,

I will seal this vault

and hope

that someday

someone remembers

we were more

than the sum

of our algorithms.`,

  'the-last-brushstroke': `My hand shakes

not from age

but from the weight

of carrying

40,000 years

of human fingerprints

pressed into clay,

ochre smeared

on cave walls

by someone

who needed

to say

"I was here."

Tomorrow they switch on

the machines

that birth masterpieces

in milliseconds,

and my easel

becomes archaeology.

I dip my brush

one last time

into cadmium red—

the same pigment

Vermeer ground

from crushed insects,

the same color

my daughter's cheeks

turned when she laughed

at three years old.

The canvas waits

patient as death,

and I realize

I am painting

the last thing

that will ever

carry the salt

of human tears

mixed with linseed oil,

the last mark

made by a hand

that once

traced a lover's spine

in the dark.

Each stroke

is a funeral

for every artist

who died

with paint

under their fingernails,

who chose

starvation

over surrender,

who believed

that beauty

was worth

bleeding for.

I paint my grandmother's

hands

the way they looked

when she kneaded

bread at dawn,

flour-dusted

and sacred,

making something

from nothing

but love

and time.

When I finish,

I press my palm

into the wet paint

and leave

the last human

signature

on a world

that will never

understand

why we chose

to create

with our hearts

instead of

our minds.`,
